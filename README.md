# C-Library
Re-written standart C functions

Additional functions:
	ft_substr
Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a substring
from the string ’s’.
The substring begins at index ’start’ and is of
maximum size ’len’.

	ft_strjoin
Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new
string, which is the result of the concatenation
of ’s1’ and ’s2’.

	ft_strtrim
Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a copy of
’s1’ with the characters specified in ’set’ removed
from the beginning and the end of the string.

	ft_split
Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns an array
of strings obtained by splitting ’s’ using the
character ’c’ as a delimiter. The array must be
ended by a NULL pointer.

	ft_itoa
Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a string
representing the integer received as an argument.
Negative numbers must be handled.

	ft_strmapi
Applies the function ’f’ to each character of the
string ’s’ to create a new string (with malloc(3))
resulting from successive applications of ’f’.

	ft_lstnew
Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new
element. The variable ’content’ is initialized
with the value of the parameter ’content’. The
variable ’next’ is initialized to NULL.

	ft_lstadd_front
Adds the element ’new’ at the beginning of the
list.

	ft_lstsize
Counts the number of elements in a list.

	ft_lstlast
Returns the last element of the list.

	ft_lstadd_back
Adds the element ’new’ at the end of the list.

	ft_lstdelone
Takes as a parameter an element and frees the
memory of the element’s content using the function
’del’ given as a parameter and free the element.
The memory of ’next’ must not be freed.

	ft_lstclear
Deletes and frees the given element and every
successor of that element, using the function ’del’
and free(3).

	ft_lstiter
Iterates the list ’lst’ and applies the function
’f’ to the content of each element.

	ft_lstmap
Iterates the list ’lst’ and applies the function
’f’ to the content of each element. Creates a new
list resulting of the successive applications of
the function ’f’. The ’del’ function is used to
delete the content of an element if needed.
